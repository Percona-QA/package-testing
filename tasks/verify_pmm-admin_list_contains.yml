# Assertion wrapper for readabilityâ€™s sake.
# This task verifies that specified string is present in the "pmm-admin list" command's output
#
# Task arguments are handled by parent playbook vars:
#         var "port_flag"    : to access agent with custom port
#                               ex: port_flag: "--pmm-agent-listen-port={{ custom_port }}"
#         var "expected"     : string argument to search
#                               ex: expected: "MySQL"
#
#   must be called with "expected" variable, ex:
#  - name: some name for the task
#    include_tasks: ../tasks/verify_pmm-admin_list_contains.yml
#    vars:
#      expected: "string to search and assert"
#
